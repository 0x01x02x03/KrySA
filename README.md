_Statistical analysis for rats._

A common translation of the word "krysa" is "a rat", mostly considered a lower creature, but in fact a really cute and intelligent little rodent.

The idea behind KrySA is to make statistical software available even for the "rats" - people who can't or don't want to buy a commercial tool for statistics for whatever reason. KrySA is a free, open-source tool that anyone can afford!

KrySA is written in [Python 2.7](https://python.org) using [Kivy](https://kivy.org) framework together with [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org). To run it you have to have all of them installed.
