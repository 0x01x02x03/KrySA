The Software
------------

KrySA is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL, or “free
software”).

This license grants people a number of freedoms:

* You are free to use KrySA, for any purpose
* You are free to distribute KrySA
* You can study how KrySA works and change it
* You can distribute changed versions of KrySA

The GPL strictly aims at protecting these freedoms, requiring everyone to share
their modifications when they also share the software in public. That aspect is
commonly referred to as Copyleft.

License details

.. |psf| replace:: Python License
.. _psf: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/LICENSE
.. |mit| replace:: MIT License
.. _mit: https://github.com/kivy/kivy/blob/master/LICENSE
.. |spy| replace:: SciPy

.. |mpl| replace:: based on Python License

The developed KrySA source code is by default licensed as GNU GPL Version 3.

KrySA also uses some modules/libraries from other projects. For example Python
uses the |psf|_, Kivy uses the |mit|_, |spy|_ and |npy|_ use the 3-clause BSD
License, and MatPlotLib uses a license |mpl|_.

All the components that together make KrySA are compatible under the GNU GPL
Version 3. That is also the license to use for any distribution of KrySA
binaries.

Your output
-----------

What you create with KrySA (e.g. :ref:`sqlite` or :ref:`results`) is your sole
property. All your other output, meaning images/graphs, tables, etc. including
the ``.krysa`` files and other data files Krysa can write, is free for you to
use as you like.

That means the application can be used commercially by anyone to work on
commercial projects, research, or for educational purposes.

KrySA’s GNU GPL license guarantees you this freedom. Nobody is ever permitted
to take it away, in contrast to trial or “educational” versions of commercial
software that will forbid your work in commercial situations.
