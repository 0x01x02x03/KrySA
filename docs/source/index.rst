`Statistical analysis for rats.`

A common translation of the word "krysa" is "a rat", mostly considered a lower
creature, but in fact a really cute and intelligent little rodent.

The idea behind KrySA is to make statistical software available even for the
"rats" - people who can't or don't want to buy a commercial tool for statistics
for whatever reason. KrySA is a free, open-source tool that anyone can afford!
