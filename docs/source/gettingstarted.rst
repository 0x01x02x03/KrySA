Getting started
===============

.. warning:: KrySA is still in pre-alpha, most of the features are buggy or not
   yet supported. Read :ref:`contribute` section if you want to help speed up
   the process.

KrySA runs on Kivy framework, therefore it is possible to run it on any of
available platforms for Kivy, mainly Windows, Linux and Mac with all required
packages correctly compiled:

- `Kivy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kivy>`_
- `SciPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`_
- `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy/>`_
- `MatPlotLib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib>`_

There's no executable for KrySA yet, you'll need to install it from source and
run with Python until there is a release available.

Minimum system requirements
---------------------------

=============== ========================================================
RAM             At least 256 MB
Disk space      At least 400 MB free(*)
Resolution      Minimum of 800 x 600
CPU             ? ? ?
GPU             Anything with OpenGL 2.0 support should be enough
Internet        Necessary for downloading requirements and updating

Installation
------------

.. |nspywhl| replace:: here
.. _nspywhl: https://anaconda.org/carlkl/packages
.. |kivyinstall| replace:: Kivy Installation
.. _kivyinstall: https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html

First of all you'll need `Python <https://python.org>`_. To simplify the
process use `KivyInstaller <https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/KivyInstaller>`_ on
Windows, which will install Python together with Kivy. On other platforms use
|kivyinstall|_ page as reference.

.. note:: KrySA requires the latest version of Kivy. It's available either as
   daily-builds on ``ppa`` or as the ``.whl`` files uploaded on Google Drive.
   If none of those are good, compile Kivy from source.

Then it gets a little bit harder with SciPy and NumPy because those need to be
compiled and it sometimes doesn't work with Windows. For this case we will use
already compiled packages in ``.whl`` files. You can find them either on pypi
or |nspywhl|_. Choose packages for Python 2.7 (cp27). On Linux they should work
without issues with ``pip install <package>``. ::

    pip install <path to package>.whl

Then install MatPlotLib. This is easy even on Windows::

    pip install matplotlib

Getting KrySA
-------------

There are many ways how to get it, but basically you need to download it from
the `official repository <https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/KrySA>`_.

#. Pip

   KrySA is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/krysa>`_, simply
   type::

       pip install krysa

   and then run it with::

       python -m krysa

#. Git

   Clone the whole repository and be able to update KrySA when a new version
   arrives with a simple ``git pull``. ::

       git clone https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/KrySA

#. Zip

   Click on the ``Clone or download`` button, download the zip file and unpack
   its contents.

When the repo clone(git/zip) of KrySA is ready, simply navigate into it and
run::

    python main.py

About docs
----------

The documentation includes source with notes how most of the things work for
example which widgets are connected, what's needed to call to make a custom
:ref:`task` and other related stuff.

Each documented class or function/method will have a little `source` link on
the right side. This will send you to its place in the code. In the code
there are similar `docs` links (they'll return you back) at the same place as
it was for the `source` in modules' documentation.
